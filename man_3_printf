.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.fi
.PP
.RS -4
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions in the
.BR _printf ()
family produce output according to a
.I format
as described below.
The functions
.BR _printf ()
write output to
.IR stdout ,
the standard output stream.
.PP
.PP
.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending
in its initial shift state, if any.
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
characters (not
.BR % ),
which are copied unchanged to the output stream;
and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or
more subsequent arguments.
Each conversion specification is introduced by
the character
.BR % ,
and ends with a
.IR "conversion specifier" .
In between there may be an optional
.IR "length modifier" .
.PP
For some numeric conversions a radix character ("decimal point").
.PP
.SS Length modifier
Here, "integer conversion" stands for
.BR d ,
.BR i ,
.BR b ,
.BR o ,
.BR u ,
.BR x ,
or
.B X
conversion.
.TP
.B h
A following integer conversion corresponds to a
.I short
or
.I unsigned short
argument.
.TP
.B l
A following integer conversion corresponds to a
.I long
or
.I unsigned long
argument.
.TP
.SS Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR d ", " i
The
.I int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.BR b ", " o ", " u ", " x ", " X
The
.I "unsigned int"
argument is converted to unsigned binary
.RB ( b ),
unsigned octal
.RB ( o ),
unsigned decimal
.RB ( u ),
or unsigned hexadecimal
.RB ( x
and
.BR X )
notation.
The letters
.B abcdef
are used for
.B x
conversions; the letters
.B ABCDEF
are used for
.B X
conversions.
.TP
.B c
The
.I int
argument is converted to an
.IR "unsigned char" ,
and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The
.I "const char\ *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer
to a string).
Characters from the array are written up to (but not
including) a terminating null byte ('\\0').
.TP
.B S
The
.I "const char\ *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer
to a string).
Characters from the array are written up to (but not
including) a terminating null byte ('\\0') with non printable characters
replaced \x followed by their ASCII value in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B r
The
.I "const char\ *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer
to a string).
Characters from the array are written up to (but not
including) a terminating null byte ('\\0') in reverse order.
.TP
.B R
The
.I "const char\ *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer
to a string).
Characters from the array are written up to (but not
including) a terminating null byte ('\\0') with letters modified using ROT13.
.TP
.B p
The
.I "void\ *"
pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B %
A \(aq%\(aq is written.
No argument is converted.
The complete conversion
specification is \(aq%%\(aq.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, this functions returns the number of characters
printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
