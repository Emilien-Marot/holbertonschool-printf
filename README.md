# project printf
This project is a partial recreation of printf as the function \_printf

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** C

The \_printf function prints the string, \_print\_var is called to task the correct function to print each variable and a variety of function manage every data type to be displayed

## Optimizations
It could be improved to handle more data types and using function pointers in \_print\_var to be easier to improve in the future

## Lessons Learned:
While the programming aspect was nothing new to me, I am not used to writing READMEs and function descriptions
